Durban - eThekwini Municipality says it has boosted Metro Police visibility in the city in a bid to clamp down on traffic and by-law violations. “In a bid to ensure public safety and adherence to traffic laws and city by-laws, eThekwini Municipality has increased police visibility by deploying more Metro Police officers throughout the city. Drivers are warned that transgressions such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, reckless driving, double parking and excessive hooting will not be tolerated.” “The Mercury” newspaper reported on Wednesday that the municipality is looking to employ 200 new Metro Police officers. Deputy head of Metro Police, Sbonelo Mchunu, told “The Mercury” that the unit wanted to have at least 6  000 officers by 2028.  “We are looking to close the deficit. We were supposed to have 5 000 metro police by 2010. We are at 2 500 at the moment.” Mchunu also said that the recruits would first be trained as authority officers dealing with by-law enforcement, and they would, thereafter, be trained in law enforcement, which would include SAPS training. A metro police law and traffic enforcement report showed that there were 26  964 traffic-related offences, 3  857 by-law offences, 12 vehicles impounded, 215 people arrested, 132 motor vehicle incidents attended to, and 300 vehicles searched during festive season operations.
