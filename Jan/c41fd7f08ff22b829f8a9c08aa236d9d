Durban - A dog was rescued from a manhole in Edmund Moore Road, oThongathi, North of Durban on Monday afternoon by the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT). Riza Sadack, media liaison for the community based non-profit CERT, said that they were alerted to the incident on Monday afternoon.  “At approximately 14:30 pm CERT volunteers received a call for assistance after a dog was discovered trapped down a manhole on Edmund Moore Road, Tongaat.”   Sadack said that CERT volunteers were dispatched and upon arrival found a dog inside an open manhole.  “The canine appeared scared and anxious. A CERT volunteer was lowered down the manhole to the dog, which was brought back up to safety.”  Sadack said that the dog was handed over to the SPCA.  “Thankfully, the dog did not seem to have suffered any injuries and was handed over to SPCA. Thank you to SPCA and CERT volunteers for responding.” In a separate incident earlier this month “The Mercury” newspaper reported that a litter of puppies was rescued after falling down a manhole on Estuary Drive in the Riverview area of Verulam. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said the owner of the dog contacted Rusa.  “The owner reported that their dog gave birth and her litter fell into the drain. Reaction officers removed the cover, climbed down the shaft and rescued five puppies.” Balram added that the puppies were not injured. THE MERCURY
