Durban – The ANC in eThekwini says it cannot be solely blamed for the problems that are plaguing the municipality. This sentiment was expressed by ANC councillor Nkosenhle Madlala who said the eThekwini municipality is governed through a multi-party executive committee (Exco) and not an executive mayor system. The ANC in recent times has come under fire for poor service delivery and sewage spills which led to the closure of some beaches during the festive season. “We must remind ourselves that we are not an executive mayoral system,  we do not have a “mayco (mayoral committee).” He said the mayor in eThekwini presides over a multi-party executive committee and therefore all parties represented in the committee had a role to play in terms of oversight and a duty to take responsibility for the decisions that were made. “It's part of their responsibilities therefore when things go wrong all of us as parties represented in the executive committee must take some level of responsibility,” said Madlala. He said while the ANC has many seats in the council, it doesn’t have an outright majority and the party consults with other parties when it comes to taking a decision. He said Exco should take responsibility for what goes on the city and the blame should not be placed at the door of mayor. THE MERCURY
