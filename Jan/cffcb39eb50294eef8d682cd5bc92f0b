Durban – KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) MEC and former premier of the province Sihle Zikalala has resigned following his redeployment to the National Assembly by Luthuli House. The ANC in KZN said it had discussed and accepted Zikalala’s resignation. ANC provincial secretary Bheki Mtolo said the ANC told Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube to process the resignation. He said the resignation had necessitated the reconfiguration of the provincial executive committee. The premier would introduce the new MEC once the ANC had finalised its deployment process and completed consultations with the structures of the ANC. “The ANC salutes Comrade Sihle Zikalala for serving the organisation and the people of this province with distinction. Many comrades and the people of this province will attest to his commitment as he carried out his responsibilities as deployed by the ANC,” Mtolo said. “We are confident that in his new deployment, Khuzeni will sustain and accelerate the agenda of the National Democratic Revolution.” What to know about Zikalala: WhatsApp your views to this story 071485 7995 Daily News
