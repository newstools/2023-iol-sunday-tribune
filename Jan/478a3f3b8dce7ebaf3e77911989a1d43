Durban -The Port of Durban has put in place mitigation plans to improve marine craft availability in the port.  The Transnet Port Authority (TNPA) on Monday said there had been a number of breakdowns of its tugs in the past week. Mpumi Dweba-Kwetana, port manager of Durban, said in a statement that the port is working to ensure minimal impact on operations and to bring the tug availability back to normal.  “As at January 27, tug availability averaged three tugs instead of the normal five.Tug Indlazi has been deployed from the Port of Ngqura to increase marine craft availability with the tug expected to reach the port by Tuesday (January 31),” she said. She added that this would increase the number of available tugs to four.  “One tug is in dry dock completing a Hull Certification. Once completed which is expected to be on February 1, this will increase the total number of available tugs and enable the port to adequately service vessels berthing at the port.” Dweba-Kwetana said the Port of Durban is also in the process of acquiring two second-hand tugs, with a maximum age of five years, which are expected to be delivered by August. While in other to boost spare capacity, three other tugs - Palmiet, Pholela and Umsunduzi – which are currently getting an overhaul on their propulsion units - are expected to be back in operation by the end of April 2023.
