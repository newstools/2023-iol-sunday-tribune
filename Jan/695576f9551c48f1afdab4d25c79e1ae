According to the municipality, Ntombela died on Saturday morning in hospital where he had been hospitalised for more than three weeks due to illness. Ntombela was appointed as municipal manager on October 1, 2022, after a lengthy and intensive process to find a suitably qualified candidate to take the helm, the municipality said. “His untimely passing has been a great shock to the municipality and the entire municipal council, as Dr Ntombela was expected to be discharged from hospital and resume his official duties in the new year,” Zama had said. Zama said Ntombela joined the municipality in an acting capacity in July 2021 and was later appointed on a five-year contract as a municipal manager in October 2022.   THE MERCURY
