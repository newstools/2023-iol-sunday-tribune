Durban - City of uMhlathuze mayor Xolani Ngwezi received two traffic vehicles which were donated by private company Hulamin on Wednesday. Ngwezi said he welcomed the donation of the vehicles. “It marks the realisation of my dream. A dream of holding hands with all captains of industries in uMhlathuze and working together on a goal of bettering and developing the lives of our people.” Ngwezi added that last year he had a breakfast meeting with all captains of industries and challenged them to work together with the municipality in developing the City.  “I therefore applaud Hulamin and other companies who have heeded that call. It is my belief that at all times, the private sector, local industries, should not be far from the local people, there should always be ways and means of integrating with them in one way or another.” He added that apart from the donation of the vehicles, Hulamin was also funding the recruitment of six additional traffic officers.  “We again applaud such a progressive and significant move. These contributions by Hulamin will go a long way in assisting the City in dealing with high traffic volumes mostly caused by trucks transporting goods in and around Richards Bay. This will bring significant relief to our road users.” Ngwezi called upon other private sector companies to come on board and make a contribution.  “In actual fact, this important contribution by Hulamin comes at a time where the city council and administration is working day and night on crime-prevention strategies for the City of uMhlathuze as the council has approved such a plan.
