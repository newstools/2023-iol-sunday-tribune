The municipality said programmes would also be put in place to deal with illegal immigrants who abused the system and broke by-laws. The revelations drew a mixed reaction from the city’s residents One local said: “There is no need for discussion of illegal immigrants. We must apply South African law – period. United Nations cannot assist us kuleyo  (in that).” Another resident said: “Establish the refugee camps and all refugees must be kept there –finish and klaar.” THE MERCURY
